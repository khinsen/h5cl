# h5cl

A high-level HDF5 interface for Common Lisp, building on the [low-level CFFI](https://github.com/HDFGroup/hdf5-cffi) from the HDFGroup.

This is experimental code for now. Read it, play with it, but don't rely on it.

The name expresses the long-term goal: h5cl is to [numcl](https://github.com/numcl/numcl) as [h5py](http://www.h5py.org/) is to [NumPy](https://numpy.org/). But I don't promise it will ever get there.
